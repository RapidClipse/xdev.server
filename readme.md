## Features
The RapidClipse Framework provides you with a standard-compliant application base for building-up powerful, flexible and scaleable Java business apps in record time. Instead of technical low-level programming, you can concentrate on functional features.

### Base Architecture
Standard-compliant and scalable 3-tier architecture with predefined separation of UI, business logic, data (entities) and adata access layer as a solid and scalable application basis for your individual business application.

### App Infrastructure
Powerful application infrastructure with many important basic functions that every modern business application needs, e.g. authentication and authorization with user-dependend UI content, internationalization, UI recovery, and much more. Out-of-the-box available, stable and supported.

### Databinding
Type safe databinding layer for transferring any kind of beans (mostly JPA Entities) to any Vaadin UI component. Supports lazy-loading between server and database. Entity-bound containers reflect filter, sorting, and paging into the database. Supports Bean Validation (JSR-303) for entities (Model) and UI-layer.

### Fully JPA Entity Lifecycle Management
Fully automatded Hibernate entity lifecycle and transaction management. Simplifies the use of Hibernate dramatically. No Hibernate expert know-how required. API for individual transaction handling allows professionals taking fully control at any time.

### Lazy-Loading of all Layers
The RapidClipse framework provides a Vaadin container implementation that offers integrated lazy loading between the database and server and between the server and user interface simultaneously.

### Master-Detail
Master-detail API for fully automated filtering and showing data by using master-detail views containing List- and ComboBoxes, Tables Trees and Forms.

### Filter API
Enables you to filter at model level (Vaadin Container), pre-defined filters, free text search, also ranges, filtering within the database.

### GUI Persistence API
The UI persistence enables you to save the entire UI setup at any time for getting exactly the same UI setup after restarting the

### Internationalization
String-resource management (property files) for the internationalization of individual views or the entire user interface.

### Connection- & Statement Pooling
Provides C3P0 as a standard implementation for parallel JDBC connection pooling, with support for caching and reusing of prepared

### Hibernate Second-level-Cache
To accelerate your database operations RapidClipse uses Ehcache as second-level- chache f√ºr Hibernate.

## AA Framework

### Authentication
User authentication is enabled by default in RapidClipse via LDAP and database. Docking to existing database structures via mapping. Easy to use configuration wizard.

### Authorization
Enables you to ipmort data for permissions, roles and users from any data source, e.g. databases, LDAP and XML. Let's you connect permissions with your user interface in a simple way. The framework then takes control of the entire user interface construction, shows, hides, enables or disables all relevant controls automatically.

## Mobile-Kit
The RapidClipse Mobile-Kit is a Vaadin extension that gives hybrid mobile apps fully access to all important hardware and system functions of mobile devices. Thereby, RapidClipse enables you to develop innovativ IoT and Industry 4.0 apps impressive easily.

### Device Info
Readout the device data, including manufacturer, model, operating system and version as well as the serial number of the device.

### Device Buttons
Registration of pressed device buttons.

### Accelerometer
Access to the accelerometer of the device. This enables you to register a rotation or tilt of the device.

### Vibration
Lets you activate single vibration with variable duration as well as vibration patterns with individual duration and breaks.

### Geolocation
Reading the current position of a device via length and width degrees as well as the hight above sea level. Tracking the position by dynamic data (direction & speed) is also possible.

### Compass
Querying the cardinal direction in degrees in terms of geographic, as well as on the magnetic north pole.

### Contacts
Readout the contact database, selecting, editing and saving contacts on the mobile device.

### Local File System
Read access to the local file system of the mobile device.

### Barcode Scanner
Access to all important barcode scanners, including: QR, Data Matric, UPC E/A, EAN 8/13, Code 128/93/39, CodeBar, ITF, RSS 14/Expanded, PDF417, MSI, Aztec.

### Camera
Access to the photo and video function, front and back camera, direct transmission of images and videos to the server, storing on the mobile device as well as access to the local image

### NFC
Read and write NFC tags. This enables you to communicate with any RFID components, which is an important prerequisite for developing solutions for the Internet of Things.

### Bluetooth
Access to the Bluetooth interface, which still plays an important role in Industry 4.0 applications.

### Sending SMS
Sending SMS messages enables you to develop great communication services.

## Lightweight. Easy to use. Free.

### Based on JavaSE
Based on the Java Standard Edition. No JavaEE know-how required. No JavaEE application server required. Runs in each servlet container, e.g. Tomcat.

### Open Source
The RapidClipse Framework is released as open source under the AGPL license.
