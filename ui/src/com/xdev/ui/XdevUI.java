/**
 * The topmost component in any component hierarchy. There is one UI for every
 * Vaadin instance in a browser window. A UI may either represent an entire
 * browser window (or tab) or some part of a html page where a Vaadin
 * application is embedded.
 * <p>
 * The UI is the server side entry point for various client side features that
 * are not represented as components added to a layout, e.g notifications, sub
 * windows, and executing javascript in the browser.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a new UI instance is needed, typically because the user opens a URL in a
 * browser window which points to e.g. {@link VaadinServlet}, all
 * {@link UIProvider}s registered to the current {@link VaadinSession} are
 * queried for the UI class that should be used. The selection is by default
 * based on the <code>UI</code> init parameter from web.xml.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After a UI has been created by the application, it is initialized using
 * {@link #init(VaadinRequest)}. This method is intended to be overridden by the
 * developer to add components to the user interface and initialize
 * non-component functionality. The component hierarchy must be initialized by
 * passing a {@link Component} with the main layout or other content of the view
 * to {@link #setContent(Component)} or to the constructor of the UI.
 * </p>
